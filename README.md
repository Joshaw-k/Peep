# Peeps

Welcome to Peeps! This repository contains two distinct applications: Peeps with a user interface and Peep's backend. These apps were developed as a proof of concept for a hackathon, bringing you an exciting social media platform with extended capabilities infused by blockchain technology.

## Overview

In both apps, Peeps offers an interesting and innovative way to interact using the decentralized web, it allows users the basic functionality of traditional social media platforms with the extended functionality of an application with games and an on-chain wallet that allows users to send and receive assets all in one app.

### Features

1. **Account Creation and Profile Set-Up:** Users create their accounts using their supported Ethereum wallet of choice, for example, Metamask, Coinbase, etc, this gives them access to interacting on the platform.
2. **Standard Social Media Functionality:** After users create their accounts, they now can create, read, update and delete their posts, as well as read, comment and 'repeep' other users post.
3. **Recommendation Algorithm:** The DApp runs a complex algorithm engine inside of the Cartesi machine which generates for users recommendations to posts and other contents based on their activities within the DApp. The recommendation algorithm tracks activities such as likes, comments and posts which suggest the user's interests and recommends to the user similar content.
4. **Web 3 Wallet:** This feature distinguishes Peeps from other existing social media platforms as it allows users to leverage decentralized finance (DeFi) brought upon by Blockchain technology. Users regardless of their location can send and receive funds as well as other digital assets.
5. **Arcade:** This is also an additional feature that allows users to access a variety of cool and exciting games. Games built and deployed using Cartesi can be plugged into Peeps and users would not only have a social media platform but also a gaming center for relaxation and more fun.

*Note: At the stage of this presentation, all of these features are in their most basic form, the development team has _ideas and _a _roadmap__ to building_ a more robust platform with more features that extend the ability of Peeps _as well _as _improve__ general and_ overall user experience.*

### Why Cartesi?

We chose Cartesi to run the social recommendations, DeFi and game logic because it allows for the implementation of intricate and complex algorithms and computations that might be challenging to accomplish using the Solidity language.

### Live the Experience With Your Peeps

After the algorithm completes its calculations and log generation on the backend, users can observe changes and updates to their content recommendations through a cool user interface created with the React frontend.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: The entire frontend is developed with React. All assets, including fonts, images, and sprites for animations, are sourced from the internet.

- **Backend**: The backend is developed using Javascript and runs inside the Cartesi machine. This version only performs the basic functionalities highlighted above without the more complex functionalities.

- **Frontend-Backend Interaction**: The front end interacts with the backend using Sunodo.

## Getting Started

Each project comes with a dedicated README file, providing detailed instructions on how to run and interact with the applications.

So, drum-rolls pleaseü•Å, welcome to the future of decentralized social interactions powered by a convenient and friendly user interface that gives prioritsises optimal a wonderful experience!
